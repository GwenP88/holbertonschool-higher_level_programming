# Python – Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## 📚 Description
This project is part of the **Holberton School – Higher Level Programming** curriculum.  
It focuses on understanding and using **Python data structures**, mainly **lists** and **tuples**, through a series of practical functions.

The goal is to learn how to manipulate collections of data efficiently while respecting strict coding constraints and style guidelines.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without external help:

- What lists are and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between lists and strings
- Common list methods and their usage
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What list comprehensions are
- What tuples are and when to use them instead of lists
- What a sequence is
- Tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- How the `del` statement works

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- **Language:** Python 3.8.5  
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- **Editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must:
  - End with a new line
  - Start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Be executable
  - Follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.\*)
- No external modules allowed unless specified
- File length is checked using `wc`

## 🧩 Tasks Overview

### 0. Print a list of integers
Prints each integer from a list on a new line using `str.format()`.

### 1. Secure access to an element in a list
Safely retrieves an element from a list by index without using `try/except`.

### 2. Replace element
Replaces an element at a given index in a list.

### 3. Print a list of integers in reverse
Prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

### 4. Replace in a copy
Returns a modified copy of a list without altering the original one.

### 5. Can you C me now?
Removes all occurrences of characters `c` and `C` from a string.

### 6. Lists of lists = Matrix
Prints a matrix of integers with proper formatting.

### 7. Tuples addition
Adds two tuples element-wise and returns a new tuple of two integers.

### 8. More returns!
Returns a tuple containing the length of a string and its first character.

### 9. Find the max
Finds and returns the largest integer in a list without using `max()`.

### 10. Only by 2
Returns a list of booleans indicating whether each element is divisible by 2.

### 11. Delete at
Deletes an element from a list at a given index without using `pop()`.

### 12. Switch
Swaps the values of two variables in exactly 5 lines of code.
